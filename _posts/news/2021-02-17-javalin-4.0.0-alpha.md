## 4.0 discussion

Please write your feature requests on <a href="https://github.com/tipsy/javalin/issues/1172">GitHub</a>.

### 4.0.0.ALPHA0 (17th of February)

This version is very similar to 3.13.3 (the last 3x version).

There is one breaking change, which is the extraction of inline reified functions from `Context` and `WsContext`.
These functions lead to non-deterministic behavior in Mockk and Mockito, which made it hard to write mock tests.

Jackson has been bumped to 2.12.1, which actually required bumping to Kotlin 1.4 too.

The `HttpResponseException` class now properly serializes the details map to an object, rather than an array of key/value pairs.

### 4.0.0.ALPHA1 (18th of April)

* You can now validate empty strings in `Validator`
* Content-Type can now be null for `UploadedFile`
* `WsHandler` is now `WsConfig`
* Context extensions (`Context#register`/`Context#use`) have been removed
* JavalinVue now supports Vue3
* Exceptions while writing responses in async mode are now handled gracefully
* Can now set explicit "includes" in OpenAPI (ex: `.includePath("/api")`
* Added option to log Jetty info during startup
* Removed dependency on Jetty from OpenAPI plugin
