## 4.0.0.ALPHA0

This version is very similar to 3.13.3 (the last 3x version).
There is one breaking change, which is the extraction of inline reified functions from `Context` and `WsContext`.
These functions lead to non-deterministic behavior in Mockk and Mockito, which made it very hard to write tests.
