## 4.0.0.ALPHA0 (17th of February)

This version is very similar to 3.13.3 (the last 3x version).

There is one breaking change, which is the extraction of inline reified functions from `Context` and `WsContext`.
These functions lead to non-deterministic behavior in Mockk and Mockito, which made it hard to write mock tests.

Jackson has been bumped to 2.12.1, which actually required bumping to Kotlin 1.4 too.

The `HttpResponseException` class now properly serializes the details map to an object, rather than an array of key/value pairs.
